# Babies-Cry-Recognition
This project is centered around the creation of a sophisticated deep learning model that aims to classify various types of baby cry sounds into eight distinct classes. These classes encompass a range of common scenarios such as stomachache, burping, discomfort, hunger, loneliness, fear, temperature-related issues, and fatigue. To accomplish this, the project undergoes a meticulous data preprocessing phase, encompassing crucial steps like resampling the audio and transforming it into spectrograms, which serve as the input representation for the model. Leveraging the power of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, implemented using the renowned TensorFlow framework, the model is meticulously designed and trained to accurately classify these complex sound patterns.

Furthermore, the developed model doesn't stop at its technical achievements alone; it finds practical application in a user-friendly Android-based mobile application named 'Halodek'. This application provides a seamless and intuitive interface for users to leverage the power of the model in real-world scenarios. With 'Halodek', parents and caregivers can efficiently analyze and interpret their baby's cries, helping them identify the underlying causes and address their child's needs promptly.

By integrating cutting-edge deep learning techniques with the convenience of mobile technology, this project showcases the potential of AI-driven solutions to enhance the understanding and care for infants. The dedication to robust data preprocessing, the utilization of CNNs, and the integration into a practical application collectively demonstrate a holistic approach to solving real-life challenges and contributing to the field of machine learning.
